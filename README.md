These are my web sites I development.

Hello everyone.
In all repositories I always manage the same format, so don't forget it ;)

Well, I will update and create new repositories for each project than I upload.
That is because I don't want to mix files wiht other projects and create garbage.
And this allows me to keep control and a structure that I develop.

Another hint or help can I give you to understand what I create, Is the READ ME.
This READ ME will contain a resume and obviously the documentation of the project.

Without more to say, I appreciate your time and take the time to READ ME.
